A chess engine and simple GUI, written in Haskell and using the TK 
framework.

This is done for my senior thesis. While performance is of interest to 
me, it's not my top goal. I'm more interested in the evaluation function 
than in doing stuff with bitboards.

Anyhow, TODO:
- Fix up this git repo. Too many files I don't need
- Make the chess engine badass
